                <p>ACTSS is a volunteer based non-profit charitable organization and is always looking for positive, dedicated volunteers to become a part of our team. As our organization continues to grow, so does our need for volunteers.</p>

                <p>ACTSS has a volunteer recognition program in place and is developing a long-service award program. We support and encourage youth volunteer participation with parental consent.</p>

                <p>ACTSS has such a wide variety of volunteer opportunities with events throughout the years. Trade show display at dog/cat shows, Pets in the Park, working a casino and major fundraising events such as our annual dog wash and Halloween extravaganza, are just a few of the types of activities we do. We are always looking for committee members as well.</p>
