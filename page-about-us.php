    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <p>The same question is asked many times to ACTSS volunteers working at booths during pet related information fairs: "What exactly does ACTSS do?" The huge smile on the face of the ACTSS volunteer indicates their tremendous pride in our society as they explain the many ways that ACTSS serves pets and their families in Alberta.</p>
        <p>ACTSS began in 1997 at a time when pets with cancer had to travel to the United States to receive radiation therapy and other types of advanced oncology treatments.  Because this was expensive and difficult for many Albertans, the majority of these pets were euthanized. Pets are family members and the premature severing of the human/animal bond due to the expense and inaccessibility of cancer therapy was tragic. Veterinary professionals and concerned pet parents came together to help affected families, and ACTSS was born.

      <h2>History</h2>
     
        <p>In March of 1997, local Edmonton media released information about a little dog named Atrayo who was receiving radiation therapy for his cancer after hours at a human cancer centre. The provincial government reacted by permanently closing the doors of all human treatment facilities to pets. Without the completion of his radiation therapy, Atrayo died a few months later. Veterinarians and politicians heard an outcry from pet owners around the country. As a result, serious analysis of the access of pets to cancer treatment programs was made.</p>

      <h2>The Chet Dobson Story</h2>
      
        <p>In July 2007 Joe and Stephanie Dobson were devastated to learn that their beloved 12 year old Lab-Husky cross Chet had a malignant tumour in his lungs. Chet had begun to cough up blood and the situation was critical. Two Calgary, Alberta specialist centres worked together to save Chet’s life. The Western Veterinary Specialist Centre performed the difficult surgery that removed the dangerous tumour from Chet’s lungs and the Calgary Animal Referral and Emergency Centre later gave Chet chemotherapy. The financial cost was high but the Dobson’s knew that Chet was worth it.</p>
