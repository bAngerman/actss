      <h2>About Us</h2>
      <div class="col">
      <p>The same question is asked many times to ACTSS volunteers working at booths during pet related information fairs: "What exactly does ACTSS do?" The huge smile on the face of the ACTSS volunteer indicates their tremendous pride in our society as they explain the many ways that ACTSS serves pets and their families in Alberta.</p>
      <p>ACTSS began in 1997 at a time when pets with cancer had to travel to the United States to receive radiation therapy and other types of advanced oncology treatments.  Because this was expensive and difficult for many Albertans, the majority of these pets were euthanized. Pets are family members and the premature severing of the human/animal bond due to the expense and inaccessibility of cancer therapy was tragic. Veterinary professionals and concerned pet parents came together to help affected families, and ACTSS was born. ACTSS amalgamated forces with the Western College of Veterinary Medicine (WCVM) to help build the first comprehensive Veterinary Oncology Centre in western Canada.</p>
      <p>ACTSS then turned to two other important pet cancer needs; making cancer treatment affordable and increasing awareness of this deadly disease to Albertans so wise choices can be made, should their pets develop cancer. ACTSS began an ambitious fundraising program to help subsidize cancer therapies for Alberta pets when it is beyond the pet parents' financial means to pay for life saving treatments. To this date, ACTSS has helped over 300 families keep their beloved pets with them for one more Christmas, one more birthday, one more summer and frequently.....a lot more than that.</p>

      <h2>History</h2>
      <div class="col">
        <p>In March of 1997, local Edmonton media released information about a little dog named Atrayo who was receiving radiation therapy for his cancer after hours at a human cancer centre. The provincial government reacted by permanently closing the doors of all human treatment facilities to pets. Without the completion of his radiation therapy, Atrayo died a few months later. Veterinarians and politicians heard an outcry from pet owners around the country. As a result, serious analysis of the access of pets to cancer treatment programs was made.</p>

        <p>Veterinarians in general practice can treat a large percentage of cancers, but many aggressive cancers need to be managed at specialized oncology centres. In 1997, no such facilities for pets existed in Western Canada. The cost of these procedures even when managed locally cost hundreds, sometimes thousands of dollars that many pet owners cannot afford. The expense and the access to therapy kept many animals from being treated for their cancers.Veterinarians, animal health technologists, pet owners and animal lovers came together and formed a group with the primary interest of developing a non-profit veterinary oncology facility in Alberta. This group became incorporated and was called the Veterinary Cancer Institute (VCI). Through dedicated work, research and with the assistance of cancer specialists, VCI teamed up with the Western College of Veterinary Medicine (WCVM) in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan to build Western Canada’s first oncology centre. The Western College of Veterinary Medicine hired a veterinary oncologist and built a facility that could run a complete oncology program, which would include radiation, chemotherapy, surgery, MRI and a critical care unit. The VCI donated a radiation machine to the facility.</p>

        <p>On September 28, 2001, ACTSS directors Dr. Jennifer Stelfox, Dr. Sheri Dalton and Ms. Marlene Kerr broke ground for the new centre at the WCVM in Saskatoon Saskatchewan. This one-of-a-kind facility opened in the spring of 2002.In October of 2001, the VCI officially became the Animal Cancer Therapy Subsidization Society (ACTSS) to better reflect its current objectives. ACTSS concentrates on making cancer therapy affordable for pet owners through a memorial fund that was established in honour of a wonderful dog named Lucky Moffat, who developed a malignant cancer at a young age, as well as through a variety of fundraising activities.
        The Lucky Moffat Memorial Fund is used to subsidize Alberta pets whose owners are unable to pay for extensive cancer treatment. All Alberta Veterinary Clinics offer information that explains how to apply for subsidization, including forms for pet owners to complete. Current forms are available on this website by clicking on Apply for Subsidy.</p>
