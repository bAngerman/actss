        <h4>Introduction</h4>
        <p>The Animal Cancer Therapy Subsidization Society is an organization providing continuing education to pet owners and Veterinarians within the Province of Alberta. In addition, as a registered non-profit charity, ACTSS has the responsibility on behalf of Canada's anti-spam legislation, to communicate with respect.

        <p>Where practical, we will try to collect Personal Information directly from the person to whom the information pertains.
        The legislation provides that an individual is deemed to consent to the collection, use or disclosure of Personal Information about that individual for a particular purpose if the individual voluntarily provides the information for that purpose, and it is reasonable that a person would voluntarily provide that information.When we collect, use or disclose personal information, we will make reasonable efforts to ensure that it is accurate and complete.
        In determining the appropriate form of consent, we will take into account the sensitivity of the Personal Information and the reasonable expectations of persons. A person may withdraw his or her consent at any time.</p>
        <h4>Use Of Information</h4>
        <p>We collect Personal Information for the following purposes (the “Identified Purposes”):
        to establish and maintain relationships with persons applying for subsidization or volunteering;
        to provide requested and ongoing services;
        to develop, enhance and/or market our public relations events
        to manage and improve our organization and operations and;
        to meet legal and regulatory requirements.</p>
        <h4>Disclosure</h4>
        <p>We will not use or disclose Personal Information for purposes other than that for which it was collected, except with the consent of the person.
        At any time, should you wish to no longer receive correspondence or publications from us, please send an email request to unsubscribe@actssalberta.ca.</p>
        <h4>Protection</h4>
        <p>We will protect Personal Information by using reasonable safeguards appropriate to the sensitivity of the information and will make reasonable efforts to protect Personal Information against loss or theft, as well as unauthorized access, disclosure, copying, use or modification regardless of the format in which it is held.
